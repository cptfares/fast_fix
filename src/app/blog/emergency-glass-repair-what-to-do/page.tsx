                A broken window can happen at any time, often when you least expect it. Whether it&apos;s due to severe weather, an accident, or vandalism, knowing how to handle the situation quickly and safely is essential. In this guide, we&apos;ll walk you through the steps to take when you experience a broken window emergency in the DMV area.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Immediate Steps to Take When a Window Breaks</h2>
              
              <p>
                When you discover a broken window, your first priority should be safety. Here&apos;s what to do immediately:
              </p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ensure everyone&apos;s safety:</strong> Keep children and pets away from the broken glass area. If the break occurred during a storm or break-in, make sure everyone is safe and secure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Secure the area:</strong> If possible, close off the room or area where the broken window is located to prevent further damage or injury.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clean up large glass pieces:</strong> Carefully pick up large pieces of glass using thick gloves and place them in a sturdy container. Avoid using a vacuum cleaner initially as it can spread fine glass particles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Temporary protection:</strong> If the break is in an exterior window, cover the opening with plywood, plastic sheeting, or a tarp to prevent water damage and secure your home. Use duct tape to hold the covering in place.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Cost Considerations for Emergency Glass Repair</h2>
              
              <p>
                Emergency glass repair services typically cost more than scheduled appointments due to the urgent nature of the service. Factors that affect the cost include:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time of day:</strong> Services during overnight hours (typically 10 PM to 6 AM) may have higher rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Type of glass:</strong> Specialty glass, such as tempered, laminated, or decorative glass, costs more to replace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Size and location:</strong> Larger windows and those in difficult-to-access locations may require more labor and equipment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Additional damage:</strong> If the break caused damage to the frame or surrounding areas, repairs will be more extensive.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Preventing Future Window Emergencies</h2>
